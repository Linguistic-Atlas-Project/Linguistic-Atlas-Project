# Linguistic-Atlas-Project Repository

Welcome to the Linguistic Atlas Project (LAP) repository. Here, we have compiled a comprehensive collection of text data from various LAP projects. These datasets are organized into standard ZIP files, making them easily accessible for researchers, linguists, and enthusiasts interested in exploring the linguistic diversity of the United States.
