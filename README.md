# Linguistic-Atlas-Project Repository

Welcome to the Linguistic Atlas Project (LAP) repository, where we have compiled a rich collection of text data extracted from various projects under LAP. These datasets, compressed into 7zip files, offer invaluable insights for researchers, linguists, and enthusiasts aiming to explore the diverse linguistic landscape of the United States.

## Project Datasets
The datasets are meticulously organized and compressed by project. Each 7zip file contains a complete set of text data (txt, csv, doc, docx, xlsx, xls, and py.) pertinent to a specific LAP project. Here is a list of the available datasets:

- DASS_part1
- GDS
- General
- Gullah
- HUVA
- LACAN
- LACOL
- LAH
- LANCS
- LANE
- LAO
- LAPNW
- LASE
- LAUM
- LAWS
- LSL

As we process more data, more datasets will be added and existing ones updated to provide a comprehensive resource pool.

## Data Access & Usage
### Install 7zip
To access the datasets, you need to install 7zip, a utility that enables the extraction of compressed files. 

#### Windows:
Download the installer directly from the [official 7-Zip website](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) and follow the installation instructions.

#### Mac:
Users can install 7zip using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with the command `brew install p7zip`, or download [ez7z](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/20507/ez7z) for a graphical interface.

#### Linux:
Use your distribution's package manager. For instance, on Ubuntu or Debian, use `sudo apt install p7zip-full`.

### Extract Data
Use the `7z x filename.7z` command in your terminal or command prompt to extract the data. Alternatively, you can double-click the file if you have a graphical interface installed.

## Additional Resources
To complement these datasets, we recommend exploring the following resources:
- [Linguistic Atlas Project Main Site](https://linguisticatlasproject.org/) for image files from the same projects.
- [Old LAP website](https://www.lap.uga.edu/Projects/) houses archived data and additional resources.
